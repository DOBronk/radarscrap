This is a work in progress, very simple and quick written scraper which works with certain API(s). It basically gathers the information it needs from an API and writes it to a MySQL database for speed trap history and statistics.

Lot's of TODO stuff when I have the time (like a simple log writer and much better error handling, some more customizable command line parameters. Could also use a bit of refactoring, but currently it does the job for me that it is intended for.
